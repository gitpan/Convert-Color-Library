NAME
    "Convert::Color::Library" - named lookup of colors from "Color::Library"

SYNOPSIS
    Directly:

     use Convert::Color::Library;

     my $red = Convert::Color::Library->new( 'red' );

     # Only use the SVG dictionary
     my $brown = Convert::Color::Library->new( 'svg/brown' );

     # Use either HTML or SVG dictionary
     my $pink = Convert::Color::Library->new( 'html,svg/pink' );

    Via Convert::Color:

     use Convert::Color;

     my $cyan = Convert::Color->new( 'lib:cyan' );

     my $darkcyan = Convert::Color->new( 'lib:windows/darkcyan' );

DESCRIPTION
    This subclass of Convert::Color::RGB8 provides lookup of color names
    using Robert Krimen's Color::Library module. It therefore provides
    convenient access to named colours in many dictionaries, such as SVG,
    X11 and HTML.

CONSTRUCTOR
  $color = Convert::Color::Library->new( $name )
    Returns a new object to represent the named color.

    If the name is of the form

     dicts/name

    Then "dicts" is parsed as a comma-separated list of dictionary names to
    pass to "Color::Library".

TODO
    *   Consider an API for getting the list of dictionary names and colour
        names. That said, it's easy enough to do directly to
        "Color::Library", so maybe not needed.

        library
